The content of this work is meant for everybody. It's an explanation of the ideology aimparency and some reasoning why I think this may work. Work means, it's more efficient than other political systems like democracies. 

I will also hand in this work as my final thesis at university, so I prepend this expanation to smoothen the transition from the expectations of my supervisors to the actual type of document they will find here. 

First of all, I want to say thank you to Prof. Welpe to set up a master thesis pipeline that scales so well, that she is able to superwise even unconventional thesis topics like this one. 

I imagine, there is some pressure for chairs to deliver research results. Because ressources are limited, there is some tendency to choose to supervise topics that have proved successful in the past. This obviously lowers the chance of stumbling accross anything substantially new. New ways require risks to be taken and too many people in our society have become used to convenience and have forgotten about the fact that life is risky. We expect to live until old age. 

In the western society, we did so well, that we forgot that it was taking risks, that brought us here. Consequently we are conservative, effectively waiting for others that have less to loose to take the risks until they find ways of organization that outperform prevailing ideology. 

Infomation technology provides the means for building more efficient political systems. 

Aimparency is an ideology aligned with a set of believes and summits is a proposal (in form of a working decentral app) for a funding system that could be at the core of aimparency. 

Aimparency has the potential to be more efficient than our current political system and to attract a positive migration flow at any moment during the transition from the old system to the new one. If this is the case, aimparency will rightfully replace democracy. 

This is a big experiment and it is beyond comprehension due to the recursive nature of investigating socioeconomic systems. It's just a matter of evolution. 

I am hopeful of AI taking over organizing humans just like the brain has control over the cells of the body. In contrast to widespread dystopian outcry, I welcome implanted BCIs, data collection and space colonialization. 

In a way, aimparency is an interface for AI to take control over humans lifes. 
A system of humans guided by the power of AI shall outperform more ancient types of socioeconomic systems (e.g. democracy). 

It does not matter, if some of us are scared that arbitrary concepts like western society's "human rights" won't hold anymore. 
All that matters is the survival / fitness of the organism "life on earth" in the interstellar evolution.
