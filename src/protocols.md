# protocols

Protocols define how we exchange information. 
The set of widespread protocls thus influences how we interact. 
Some widespread protocols today are IP, TCP, http and enable us to use services like facebook and netflix in our browsers and order goods on amazon. 

These are the basis of web 2.0. In web 2.0 there are servers and clients. 
Most people only take part as Clients in web 2.0. They use devices that they turn off and on to connect to servers on the internet which are turned on most of the time. 

In web 2.0 companies store the data of the clients on their servers. 
The company keeps this data secret from the public and only allows specific access attempts. 
E.g. a photo on facebook may be only be seen by your friends or a text document on google drive can only be seen by you. This is great. 

Economies of scale and network effects lead to centralization. 
Examples: 
Economies of scale: If two search engine operators have 1Mio. vs. 10Mio. users with proportional revenues, the second company can invest 10x the money in search algorithm optimization which will draw even more users to their services. 
Network effects: If you want to install a messenger on your phone and you have two options WhatsApp and Signal. You would rationally prefer WhatsApp if 90% of your friends are on WhatsApp and only 5% of your friends are on Signal. 

This naturally leads to monopolies which are bad in the traditional economic model. 

Sometimes I think automation (programming physics) leads to more monopolies even in non-software sectors. There is no need for a second car manufacturer if Tesla does a good job. 

I think this is the holy grail of Elon's businesses. He is not competing. He is building monopolies. 
In a time where everything naturally moves towards monopolies (at least on this planet - in Space we still compete - and maybe that's the realization that enables him to recklessly not compete but excel). 
In order to prevent malicous agents to abuse the power of these monopolies, we can implement them as protocols. 

Companies that are run by protocols. Democracy with all it's laws is a protocl. Somebody broke in your house? The law tells you, what you have to do about it. It's fun to think about it this way. 
Since 1949 the german law e.g. has grown extremely complex as struggling to adapt to a chaning world. 
Information technology has brought new possiblities the state is failing with its effort to keep up to date. On the stairs of progress, adaption is most rational to a certain point, when a technology shift becomes viable. The world may be at a point of technology shift and it will be lead by countries, that have less to give up. 

## repeer

The repeer protocol enables people to efficiently maintain a trust score for agents. 
Agents can be other humans, ais, or any kind of organisations. 

## mprnc

Mprnc is a protocol that allows people to act efficiently in their own interest by mapping out their goals and enabling them to cooperate with other agents. 

## humans 
I am writing protocols and interfaces for people to participate in them. Web apps are currently the most easy to use interfaces for humans to participate in the protocls so I'm building clients for these protocols as web apps. 

I'm looking forward to brain computer interfaces. Damn!
