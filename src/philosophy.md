## Religions
Religions are systems that influence how people interact with each other. A religion installs norms. Christianity comes with a framework on what to do and what not to do. The bible contains lots of protocols how to deal in certain situations (when people have sinned), e.g. what sacrifices to make. 
E.g. it describes how women will be treated when men have the feeling of being betrayed. In some cases, the priests will collect ressources in cases of "sins". 

This system, although flawed, enabled a more efficient and thus dominant society than what was there before. 

Next stage in the evolution of religions is economy and capitalism. It tidies up inefficient norms of previous religions and thereby boosts productivity and progress, which led to dominance. 

Nowadays, all countries of the world even though having a heritage of various religions agree on economics. It's enforcing institutions are courts and central banks. 

Democracy seems tightly linked to this religion. The ideal is that people have a saying about the system that they live by. There are some problems with this: people born after the establishment of a democracy feel just as powerless about the system as if it was dictated by a dictator. Their parents try and fail to educate them, why this democracy is good. But the power structures grew quite resistant to change. Technological progress advanced driven by economic dynamics but political power structures stayed quite static. Economic entities are so much more powerful than political power structures, that the political landscape becomes an annoying factor that is dealt with economic precision. Thus traditional politics are failing creating a paradoxon, since economy is historically enabled by politics. Courts are making sure that "pacta sunt servanda" and they provide and secure a currency. 

Every System can be tricked. Democracy can be tricked as well. It's only a matter of complexity. And the same will be true for systems based on blockchain. It'll be possible to trick them. But it's so complex, that it will hold stable for a couple of years. 

So now that it has become possible to trick democracy there will emerge a new system that's more stable. I don't believe in a transition. A ninety year old man will not be able to compete with a 20 year old that has grown up native to all the possibilities that enable this change. 

Our motivation to address the old system is to plead for a graceful power handover. We have lots of respect for your struggles and achievements and we shall always remember where we come from. 

## Crypto - Now we can code morals
Recently I used some AWS services and when they tried to bill me, it didn't work, because my credit card was expired. I receieved a friendly reminder to update my payment method and retry the payment otherwise, they would suspend my account. 

Now what's interesting is, that they are not threatening me with launching a lawsuit. Simply not providing services to non-payers anymore seems to be more economic for them, than handling thousands of tiny lawsuits with all that paperwork and formulars involved. 

The US/EU government systems lack behind so much in digital development, that it's more attractive for a company to reject governmental services in some circumstances. 
Governmental service - once enabling trade and buisiness - have become a drag on economics. 

Politics are open source. The laws are public. The laws are the protocols of society. 

Open source will replace traditional politics providing protocols that run on computers.

Look, there will never be a computer killing all humans but instead humans and computers will unite into a very efficient system. Like cells connected via nerves unite to form a body. And the structure of system will be open source software code.

We want crypto to replace national governments. We want to implement a planet wide political system.
