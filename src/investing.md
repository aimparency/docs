# investing

Aimparency is supposed to incentivize people to do useful work. 

At the moment the financial system works like this: people propose a product or service. They seek for funding. Investors who believe in the idea invest. If the investors are right, they gain. 

Thus, there is a competition to make the best possible predictions about the future. Nice. This is capitalism. This is wonderful and perfect. 

Can we figure out what exactly are the mechanisms in place? Especially, how is human nature / biology linked to the consensus about what turns out to be successful? 

Why was building e.g. graphics cards successful (from 1980 till 2020 for sure)? You could say: the demand increased. Ok. Why did the demand increase? Because people and institutions wanted to have it. Ok, why did they want to have it? Wow, and now it gets so extremely complex: suddenly, it's about human motives. (And we will be touching the gender discussion here, don't worry). Both women and men want to procreate effectively. There is a very big difference between men and women: 
Men can have 100 million kids per day. 
Women can only have around 1 kid per 9 months. 
This fact shapes physiology, and gender roles in society.

Consequently, women implement strategies to filter for the fittest men. For some reason a certain tendency towards monogamy has established in many cultures. But it's also common to find the richest or most successful men to procreate with multiple women. Kings had harems. Some cultures allow multiple women as long as their man can provide for them. 

So. Men struggle for dominance over other men. They try to do this in the most intelligent possible way. It's always a struggle between justifying procreating more than their peers. 

And here it comes. If a man takes without justification more ressources than his peers, the organisation he is part of will degenerate. 

Justification would be his contribution to the survival of the society. Let me correct: the procreation of the society. 

If someone grabs for more ressources than his contribution to society justifies, the society suffers, as ressources are not optimally allocated. This is the reason why envy exists. 

It's easy bro: you feel bad, because you prevented me access to ressources that would have benefitted our familiy more than your ego trip. 
Ich vergebe dir. It's funny how wrong you are. 

When we met on mothers day 2021, you insisted to be still stronger than I am. 

After this quick excourse into personal affairs, let's get back to getting a clear picture of how evolutional forces are tied to the investment mechanism of capitalism. 

Where does government come into play? Well. Before we had nation states, we hat smaller states and tribes. They were - although most of them geographically bound competing for survival. Just like human individuals, some of them were allies, some were warfaring. The governmental systems determined, whether famines were surived and wars won. Winning wars is a mix of tactics and technology. Different governances enable different technological progress. China e.g. was very much ahead with gunpowder, but other countries were quicker to develop weapons that effectively make use of it [todo: do some research]. If you have better weapons, you're more likely to win wars. Then technology, if you have better technology, you can extract ressources from the earth more efficiently. 

Today, in Germany, I have a lot of contact to people who idealize inefficient ways to grow plants for food. They denie the complexity and ignore the technology, that is already in place for feeding humanity and prefere to dabble around themselves, which is for them enjoyable but in fact luxury, which they are not aware of. 

We are in a war for survival. Every system always is. And then, if you are aware about it, what does change? Could you wrap your head around your existence and determine what is actually best for your survival? Or is it best to lazily lean back and let your instincts compete in autopilot. This is not either or. Trying to understand yourself and rationally implementing habits that improve your chance of procreation. If you are aware of this, that is your instincts applying aware rationality to maximize fitness. 

So governmental systems compete for survival by procreation. Maybe not actively. But by instinct they do, as their instinct has made them win wars and survive threats in the past. 

Religious systems are intervoven with governance. Rites belong to the communication structure in a society. Money developped as a tool to exchange goods. 

People are not competing for having money. They are competing for gaining money. Increase in money is positive no matter how few you have. Loss is negative no matter how much you still have.

People buy stuff, that increases their personal chance of survival and procreation. They satisfy basic needs like food and shelter, as well as procreational ones like attracting sex mates. They are steered by instincts mostly so many buy stuff like Coca Cola which is not really good for them but exploits some inefficiencies of the human reward system (like everything that can function like a drug: porn, drugs, working out even, self controlled non-eating). These are basically traps of behavioral patterns that lead to a sense fullfillment with wich to a certain point unfulfilled suppressed needs can be endured. 

So people buy stuff to fullfill their needs (which have developped to make them survive and procreate). And they learn behaviours, that make them able to buy stuff. They buy stuff that makes them buy stuff. There is this dichotomy[does this word mean what I want to say?] in western society: those who manage and those who get managed. The people and the politicians. It's strange, that we have this. I lived my life on the edge of that, because my dad certainly belongs to that upper class while my mum sympathises and belongs rather to the simple people - which was possible by their breakup (I'd say, usually parnters are on the same side). 

I think, a system in which no upper society has power over a minor society could be more efficient. Because power may leave room for inefficiencies wherease transparency could most effectively align people. 
Therefore I propose to make transparent the path of reasoning for the necessity of a "small persons" work package all the way up to societies survival and procreation. 

I hate, how managers and managed people are in a fight. How they work against each other. I hate it and I want to conciliate this. Some actors of the managing class defend against this, because it would mean a loss of unjustified advantages that they have secretly and maybe unconsciously implemented. 

Crypto is a chance to shake old power structures by building a transparent alternative system that is more efficient and thus simply dries out a struggling but old and inefficient traditional system. It's not hostile (some angry folks may be), it's just evolution. 

Here again I plead towards the old system: be a good father, pass on your responsibility wisely. Make sure you convey your experience and learned lessons humbly. 

Companies that turn out to be a good investment, produce products and services that turn out to be demanded by indiviuals for fulfilling their needs for money, sex and secondary needs like making money. 

Investors buy products and services that allow them to invest more successfully. 

How people satisfy their needs is shaped by norms. 

Unfortunately, there is little incentive for individuals to strive for the survival and procreation of the organism they are part of. When confronted with a choice to spend ressources on individual goals or on communal goals, it's in a majority of cases more useful for individual survival and procreation to spend them on the individual goals. 
To counter this, society systems have yielded mechanisms to punish asocial behaviour and reward social behavior. When growing up, young humans are introduced into this system of morals. People who do not adapt are excluded from the commons. Parasocial systems evolve on the fringe of society: Immigrant groups, criminal groups, sects. They find ways to extract ressources from the society without adhering to it's moral rules. They may be symbiotic or parasitic. 

Now these "moral" systems can be more or less efficient. 
And (Theorem) I suppose it is always possible to exploit the system.
Exploiting it requires a lot of ressources such that bowing to playing along the system is a dominant strategy for individuals. 

Also, note that parasocial systems who organize to expoit the system usually don't provide a more efficient social system internally, so that switching to such a system is usually not attractive either. 

Interestingly, technological progress may make it more feasable for individuals to exploit the dominating social system. 
The society may try to keep up and improve the system to make it less easily exploitable.
